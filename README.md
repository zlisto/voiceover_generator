Create voiceovers for videos using AI voice and text

# VoxOver: AI Narration Studio

VoxOver is a Streamlit application that lets you add AI-generated voiceovers to videos. Upload a video, provide instructions for the voiceover style, and the app will analyze your video, generate appropriate narration text, convert it to speech, and merge it with your original video.

## Features

- üé¨ **Video Analysis**: Automatically analyzes video content
- ü§ñ **AI Text Generation**: Creates contextually relevant voiceover scripts
- üó£Ô∏è **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text to natural-sounding speech with multiple voice options
- üéöÔ∏è **Audio Mixing**: Control both original audio and voiceover volume levels
- üé• **Video Processing**: Merges the voiceover with your video

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg (required for video and audio processing)
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

### 1. Install FFmpeg

**Windows:**
1. Download FFmpeg from [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (release essentials package)
2. Extract to a location (e.g., `C:\FFmpeg`)
3. Add `C:\FFmpeg\bin` to your system PATH
4. Verify by running `ffmpeg -version` in a new command prompt

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voxover.git
cd voxover
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 5. Create Temp Directory

```bash
mkdir temp
```

## Running the App

Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

For automatic reloading when code changes (useful during development):

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.runOnSave=true
```

The app will open in your default web browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## How to Use

1. **Upload Video**: Upload a video file to start the process
2. **Enter Instructions**: Provide instructions for the style and content of the voiceover
3. **Generate Text**: Generate voiceover text based on video content and instructions
4. **Edit Text**: Review and edit the generated text if needed
5. **Choose Voice**: Select from different voice options 
6. **Generate Audio**: Create the voiceover audio
7. **Adjust Volume**: Control the volume levels of both original audio and voiceover
8. **Merge**: Combine the voiceover with your video
9. **Review**: Watch the final video with voiceover

## Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Add your OpenAI API key as a secret in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
5. Deploy the app

## Troubleshooting

- **FFmpeg Errors**: Ensure FFmpeg is correctly installed and in your PATH
- **API Key Issues**: Verify your OpenAI API key is correct in the `.env` file
- **Memory Errors**: Try processing smaller videos if you encounter memory issues
- **Missing Directory Errors**: Make sure the `temp` directory exists in the project root
