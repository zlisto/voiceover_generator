I want to create a Streamlit app called "VoxOver: AI Narration Studio" that lets users upload videos and generate AI voiceovers for them. The app should have these key features:
1. Allow users to upload video files
2. Let users provide instructions for the style/content of voiceover
3. Generate voiceover text based on video content and instructions
4. Convert the text to speech using various AI voices
5. Merge the speech audio with the original video
6. Allow adjusting both the original video volume and voiceover volume
7. Let users view and download the final video with voiceover

I already have the following utility functions in my utils.py file:
- generate_voiceover_text(video_path, 
                        instructions): Analyzes a video and generates appropriate voiceover text based on user instructions
- generate_voiceover_audio_elevenlabs(text, 
                                        file_path,  
                                        model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",    
                                        voice_id="dR1Ptm3rjBUIbHiaywdJ",
                                        speed=1.0): Converts text to speech and saves as audio file
- merge_video_with_audio(video_path, audio_path, merged_path, video_volume=1.0, audio_volume=1.0): Combines video with audio file, allowing volume control for both original audio and added voiceover

Please create a complete Streamlit app (app.py) that uses these functions to create a user-friendly interface with:
- File upload functionality
- Text area for instructions
- Display of generated voiceover text with ability to edit
- Volume sliders for both original video audio and voiceover
- Tabs to show original and processed videos
- Proper handling of temporary files and error conditions
- Clear instructions for users

The app should maintain state between interactions and provide a clean, professional interface.
